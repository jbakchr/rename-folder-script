# Rename folder script
I have a tendency to name many of my folders with a consecutive number prefix - i.e. "01-folder", "02-folder" and so on.

It times, however, I delete a folder thereby breaking prefix sequence. If I, as an example, had eight folders with a prefix of "01" to "08" and then delete the "03" folder then I'd like to rename all folders coming after the deleted folder - meaning "04-folder" should now "03-folder", "05-folder" should be "04-folder" and so on.

Hence, this - very quick and dirty - script can be used to rename folders in the current directory keeping the prefix sequence.
